                            <p> Hi! I'm Oscar, a MComp Graduate from Newcaslte University and current Graduate Game Developer for tombola aspiring to move into the video games industry full-time.
                                Working in the games industry has been a dream of mine for a long time, and I'm determined to make it a reality! 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Outside of work, I'm interested in video games, esports and cooking! Some of my favourite game series are Xenoblade Chronicles, Pokémon and Kirby. Some of my favourite indie games are A Hat in Time, Celeste and OMORI!
                            </p>

                                        We made this game over the course of a week, spliting into multiple teams to create the art, level design and programming for the game. It was built to be playable in Unity's web viewer, on desktop and mobile!

                                        I was on the programming team for the game. One of my main tasks were creating the Unity TileMap for the game and adding behaviour for each tile, which allowed us to easily implement the levels that our design team made. I also made the audio system for the game and helped create the RAT character controller.
