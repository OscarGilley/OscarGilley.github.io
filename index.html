                            <p> Hi! I'm Oscar, a MComp Graduate from Newcaslte University and current Graduate Game Developer for tombola aspiring to move into the video games industry full-time.
                                Working in the games industry has been a dream of mine for a long time, and I'm determined to make it a reality! You can find some of the projects I've worked on below, with Github repos and playable demos attached where possible! 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Outside of work, I'm interested in video games, esports and cooking! Some of my favourite game series are Xenoblade Chronicles, Pokémon and Kirby. Some of my favourite indie games are A Hat in Time, Celeste and OMORI!
                            </p>

                                    <p>A Unity project made with a team of my friends! You control the level itself by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise or anticlockwise to guide the RAT to the goal.
                                        We made this game over the course of a week, spliting into multiple teams to create the art, level design and programming for the game. It was built to be playable in Unity's web viewer, on desktop and mobile!
                                        <br>
                                        I was on the programming team for the game. One of my main tasks were creating the Unity TileMap for the game and adding behaviour for each tile, which allowed us to easily implement the levels that our design team made. I also made the audio system for the game and helped create the RAT character controller.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>This project was for my 4th year module: Gaming Solutions within a Team. This project is an expansion of a previously individual project as a team of 8 students! We had to work together to create a 'Season 2' expansion for our prior game. 
                                        Teamwork and communication skills were important here to ensure the game was created successfully.
                                        <br>
                                        Within the team, I was responsible for the power up system, collision reporting, level design and creation with a custom Unity level editor and AI controlled opponents. 
                                        I also led the game design part of the project. This saw me making a list of features to be added to the game for the 4 levels created and delegating the creation of these features to my teammates.

                                    <p>A physics-based 3D platform made for my 4th year Advanced Game Technologies module. This game is inspired by Fall Guys, where the player must get to the end of a short obstacle course before time runs out! There are multiple levels with different objectives for the player to complete against AI controlled opponents.
                                        This coursework helped develop my C++ programming skills (particularly managing objects in memory) and debugging skills.

                                        This project uses a Newtonian physics model and A* pathfinding for the AI characters. Some of the advanced features in this game include collision detection and resolution with spheres, AABBs, OBBs and capsules, an advanced AI with a state machine and a menu system using pushdown automata.

                                    <p>During my undergraduate degree I made a system in Unity to analyse 2D platformer levels for cohesion and difficulty. The aim was to try and procedurally create a fairly designed level that would not overwhelm the player, but still prove to be a good challenge.
                                        Research was done into procedural content generation and level design in 2D games, with a focus on Super Mario games as a basis. The project is a good base for a system that could create fair and engaging 2D levels.

                                        Lots of varied game rules had to be implemented to make this a functioning game, such as multiple shops where the player can gain points, a life + game over system, and an invincibility balloon powerup.

                                    <p>This project was made for my 3rd year Graphics for Games module. There are multiple different effects applied to the spinning cube that make use of OpenGL shaders. 
                                        These include proper lighting and reflections, fragment/vertex shaders, tesselation shaders and geometry shaders.

                                <p>I'm currently working on live and in development arcade and bingo games for the tombola platform in international territories! My role consists of working with a team of developers and QA testers to fix bugs found on the games, and on occassion working with bosses or senior developers to improve website features.
                                    <br>
                                    My role also involves preparing newer games for release on our international territories, working closely with QA to iron out any bugs in the games pre-release.
