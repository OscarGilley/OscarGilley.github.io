                            <p> Hi! I'm Oscar, a MComp Graduate from Newcaslte University and current Graduate Game Developer for tombola aspiring to move into the video games industry full-time.
                                Working in the games industry has been a dream of mine for a long time, and I'm determined to make it a reality! You can find some of the projects I've worked on below, with Github repos and playable demos attached where possible! 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Outside of work, I'm interested in video games, esports and walking! Some of my favourite game series are Xenoblade Chronicles, Pokémon and Kirby. Some of my favourite indie games are A Hat in Time, Celeste and OMORI!

                                    <p>An Unreal Engine 5 project made with a team of my friends for the 10:10 Games Women In Games Game Jam! The game is a 2.5D platformer focused around speedrunning levels to impress a rival character!
                                        This game was made over the course of a weekend, from design to prototyping to completion. The game is built to be playable on Windows PCs, and is available on itch.io!
                                        <br><br>
                                        I was the leader of the project so it was my task to set up the project initially and manage our Github repo with a pull request system. I also collaborated with a teammate to make the cutscene system, helped with some features like the character controller 
                                        and assisted with level for the game, creating one level and adding elements to the others! I had to communicate with my team and delegate tasks effectively so that the project could be completed in the short timeframe while still being feature complete.

                                    <p>A Unity project made with a team of my friends! You control the level itself by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise or anticlockwise to guide the RAT to the goal.
                                        We made this game over the course of a week, spliting into multiple teams to create the art, level design and programming for the game. It was built to be playable in Unity's web viewer, on desktop and mobile!
                                        <br><br>
                                        I was on the programming team for the game. One of my main tasks were creating the Unity TileMap for the game and adding behaviour for each tile, which allowed us to easily implement the levels that our design team made. I also made the audio system for the game and helped create the RAT character controller.

                                    <p>This project was for my 4th year module: Gaming Solutions within a Team. This project is an expansion of a previously individual project as a team of 8 students! We had to work together to create a 'Season 2' expansion for our prior game. 
                                        Teamwork and communication skills were important here to ensure the game was created successfully.

                                        Within the team, I was responsible for the power up system, collision reporting, level design and creation with a custom Unity level editor and AI controlled opponents. 
                                        I also led the game design part of the project. This saw me making a list of features to be added to the game for the 4 levels created and delegating the creation of these features to my teammates.

This game is inspired by Fall Guys, where the player must get to the end of a short obstacle course before time runs out! There are multiple levels with different objectives for the player to complete against AI controlled opponents.
                                        This coursework helped develop my C++ programming skills (particularly managing objects in memory) and debugging skills.

                                        This project uses a Newtonian physics model and A* pathfinding for the AI characters.

                                    <p>During my undergraduate degree I made a system in Unity to analyse 2D platformer levels for cohesion and difficulty. The aim was to try and procedurally create a fairly designed level that would not overwhelm the player, but still prove to be a good challenge.
                                        Research was done into procedural content generation and level design in 2D games, with a focus on Super Mario games as a basis. The project is a good base for a system that could create fair and engaging 2D levels.

                                    <p>This project was made for my 3rd year Game Simulations module. It is a arcade style game utilising a Newtonian physics engine and state-based AI with flocking.
                                        Lots of varied game rules had to be implemented to make this a functioning game, such as multiple shops where the player can gain points, a life + game over system, and an invincibility balloon powerup.

                                        These include proper lighting and reflections, fragment/vertex shaders, tesselation shaders and geometry shaders.
