		<p class="guideheader">
		Welcome to the User Guide! Here we'll give you a quick guide on how to get started with the app, 
		doing things like searching for a room and navigating the menus.
		</p>
	
		<p class="guide">
		To start, you'll be seeing the home screen. Click on any of the buttons to go to the page for the floor it corresponds to, or click the
		magnifying glass in the top right of the screen to search for a specific room. You can also pull out the navigation tray by clicking the 
		top left button or swiping from the left edge of your screen to the right, this allows you to select a floor from a drop-down list, and 
		you can also search for a room here!
		</p>
	
		<img class="center" src="images/navidrawer.jpg" width="15%" alt="Navigation Drawer"/>
	
		<p class="guide">
		From here, you can find a room through the search or through the menu for the floor you have selected. After selecting the room you want,
		a map screen will pop up showing directions to the room from a landmark on the floor such as the stairs or the lifts. You can use this to
		navigate to the room you want to go to. You can see an example of the map below!
